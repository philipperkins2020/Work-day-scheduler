# Work day Scheduler

## Description 

In this assignment I created a work day scheduler that has blocks for each hour of the regular day. Each block of time is color coded for past, present, and future. The user is able to click in the text area and able to enter text to schedule their work day. When you click the save button it is saved to local storage.
